<p>Amazon and others found that 100 milliseconds of latency is responsible for 1% in sales. <span class="footnote-button"></span> But latency on the web is hard to overcome.</p>

<p>instant.page uses <em>just-in-time preloading</em> — it preloads a page right before a user clicks on it.</p>

<p>Before a user clicks on a link, they hover their mouse over that link. When a user has hovered for 65&nbsp;ms there is one chance out of two that they will click on that link, so instant.page starts preloading at this moment, leaving on average over 300&nbsp;ms for the page to preload.</p>

<p>On mobile, a user starts touching their display before releasing it, leaving on average 90&nbsp;ms to preload the page.</p>

<p><button class="js-click-test-button button">Test your clicking speed</button> <span class="js-click-test-results click-test-results"></span></p>

<p>You can also click the menu <span class="cta-menu--narrow">at the bottom</span> <span class="cta-menu--large">on the right</span> to experience it.</p>

<h2 id="cheating-the-brain">Cheating the brain</h2>

<p>The humain brain perceives actions taking less than 100&nbsp;ms as instant. <span class="footnote-button"></span> As a result, instant.page makes your site feel instant even on 3G (assuming your pages are fast to render).</p>

      <strong>0.1 second</strong> is about the limit for having the user feel that the system is <strong>reacting instantaneously</strong>, meaning that no special feedback is necessary except to display the result.

<h2 id="easy-on-your-server">Easy on your server and your user’s data plan</h2>

<p>Pages are preloaded only when there’s a good chance that a user is going to visit them, and it preloads only the HTML of that page, being respectful of your users’ and servers’ bandwidth and CPU.</p>

<p>It uses passive event listeners so that your pages stay smooth. It doesn’t preload when the user has data saver enabled (since version 1.2.2). It’s 1&nbsp;kB and loads after everything else. And it’s free and open source (MIT license).</p>
